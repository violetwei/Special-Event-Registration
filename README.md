## Backend 
Implement all features as business methods and make them available as RESTful services using Java Spring Technology. 
The services need to persist data by using a database. The backend application is a gradle project.

### Running the backend tests
issue *gradle test -i* in the **$REPO_ROOT/EventRegistration-Backend/** folder

Running backend tests require a database connection, you need to configure the SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL or corresponding variables in the *application.properties* file.

## Frontend
The Web UI supports the specialized features using Vue.js.

The source code for the end-to-end test cases is located in the folder **$REPO_ROOT/EventRegistration-Frontend/test/e2e/specs**
